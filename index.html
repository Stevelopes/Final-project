      <h2>Who Were the Most Picked Champions of the LEC 2021 Spring Season?</h2>
      <p>With the Spring Season officially at an end, we're taking a look at the most popular champions played this season.</p>
      <div class="champion">
        <div class="champion-profile">
          <p>Top Lane</p>
          <h3>Gnar - 37 picks</h3>
          <picture>
            <img src="./images/Gnar.jpg" alt="League-of-legends-champion 'Gnar'">
          </picture>
          <p>This cuddly creature's manoeuvrability and high damage potential made him the most popular top lane choice this season.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="runners-up">
        <h3>Renekton - 32 picks</h3>
        <p>This fighting crocodile remains a firm favourite both in and out of pro play thanks to his high base damage and crowd-control 
          ability, which make him one of the most useful champions in the early game.</p>
        <h3>Gragas - 27 picks</h3>
        <p>The bearded rabble-rouser enjoyed a surge in popularity amongst pros this season due to his ability to soak up as much damage 
          as he puts out.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      
      <div class="champion">
        <div class="champion-profile">
           <p>Jungle</p>
           <h3>Lillia - 45 picks</h3>
           <picture>
             <img src="./images/lillia.jpg" alt="League-of-legends-champion 'Lillia'">
           </picture>
           <p>This speedy fawn was by far the most popular Jungle pick this season, due in large part to her unmatched movement speed, which 
             allows her to duck and weave out of the way of projectiles while she keeps her distance from melee champs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="runners-up">
           <h3>Udyr - 41 picks</h3>
           <p>The Spirit Walker made a heck of a comeback in Spring, having not made a single LEC appearance throughout 2020. This champion 
             is one of the fastest at clearing the jungle camps, in a meta where the jungler controls the game, it’s very good that they do 
             that with alot of gold.</p>
           <h3>Hecarim - 39 picks</h3>
           <p>This ghostly centaur also boasts high movement speed and decent damage output, which made him another popular choice for pros.</p>
        </div>
      </div>


      <div class="champion">
        <div class="champion-profile">
           <p>Mid Lane</p>
           <h3>Orianna - 45 picks</h3>
           <picture>
             <img src="./images/Orianna.jpg" alt="League-of-legends-champion 'Orianna'">
           </picture>
           <p>As one of the most infamous solo-carry mid lane champions, it's not surprising that Orianna was once again one of the top picks
           in the LEC this season. Very good at controlling fights.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="runners-up">
           <h3>Azir - 34 picks</h3>
           <p>As one of the most unpredictable champions in League of Legends, it makes sense that this notoriously difficult champion should
              rise to the top of professional play. The Emperor of the Sands' popularity most likely stems from the fact that he is a good 
              counter for both Syndra and Orianna, the other most popular mid lane champs of the season.</p>
           <h3>Syndra - 25 picks</h3>
           <p>Syndra's popularity dropped slightly in 2021, but that didn't stop her from stunning entire teams and massive burst</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      
      <div class="champion">
        <div class="champion-profile">
           <p>Bot Lane</p>
           <h3>Kai'Sa - 71 picks</h3>
           <picture>
             <img src="./images/kai sa.png" alt="League-of-legends-champion 'Kai'Sa'">
           </picture>
           <p>The Daughter of the Void had a bumper season, emerging as easily the most popular bot lane choice of Spring. Easy to dish out 
             alot of damage in a short time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="runners-up">
           <h3>Xayah - 37 picks</h3>
           <p>This rebel marksman was another popular choice in Spring, but fell short of the top spot, possibly because her bread-and-butter 
             combo is a little harder to hit than some other champions.</p>
           <h3>Jhin - 23 picks</h3>
           <p>The LEC's pros third bot lane pick was none other than the virtuoso, Jhin. With long range and crowd-control in his kit, it makes Jhin a solid pick.</p>
        </div>
      </div>


      <div class="champion">
        <div class="champion-profile">
           <p>Support</p>
           <h3>Rell - 54 picks</h3>
           <picture>
             <img src="./images/Rell.jpg" alt="League-of-legends-champion 'Rell'">
           </picture>
           <p>The Iron Maiden was the top choice in the LEC due to her tanky abilities which allow her to build up strong resistances.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="runners-up">
           <h3>Alistar - 52 picks</h3>
           <p>This fearsome minotaur has been a popular meta pick for a while now, and his ability to support bot lane champs like Jhin and Xayah made him a top 
             choice for support players this Spring Season.</p>
           <h3>Leona - 26 picks</h3>
           <p>Last but certainly not least, we have the Radiant Dawn, Leona. Can lock down the opposition for a long time, giving her team plenty of time to kill the carries.</p>
